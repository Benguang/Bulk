Welcome to Bulk's documentation!
================================

Bulk is a library for writing parallel and distributed software.

API
---

Bulk provides a modern bulk-synchronous parallel API which is [documented in detail here](api/index.md).

Philosophy
----------

Bulk strives to provide a modern interface for writing performant parallel and distributed software. The lowest level is to be implemented with heavily optimized technologies such as MPI, while the higher levels provide a level of abstraction that allows average developers to develop highly efficient parallel software for both HPC and Big Data applications.

The Bulk project aims to provide the performance and fine-grain tunability of HPC software libraries such as MPI, with the ease-of-programming commonly found in Big Data platforms such as Hadoop and Spark.
